```{python}
import json
import jsonschema2md
from IPython.display import Markdown
from bdns_plus.env import Env
from bdns_plus._utils import data_as_yaml_markdown

```

`bdns-plus` is designed to "just-work" and assumes a set of sensible defaults.
That said, it is also possible to configure `bdns-plus` to better suit your projects requirements.
Configuration is achieved through the setting of environment variables, defined below.

## Configuration Properties
```{python}
parser = jsonschema2md.Parser(
    examples_as_yaml=False,
    show_examples="all",
)
md_lines = parser.parse_schema(Env.model_json_schema())
Markdown(''.join(md_lines[2:]))
```

By default, they are set as follows:

```{python}
Markdown(data_as_yaml_markdown(Env().model_dump()))
```
